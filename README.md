<h1>Discord App</h1>
 <p>This application is connected to a Discord bot. You can add commands through the Discord app and handle them from the backend.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Users need to create a Discord account and sign up in the application as a user.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Users are authorized to view only their own data.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Handler:</strong> The application includes a route to track all subscriptions a user has.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Discord Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a Discord account if you don't already have one.</li>
        <li>Create a server.</li>
        <li>Create a bot on the server with the necessary permissions and copy the bot's TOKEN. Paste this TOKEN into the project's <code>.env</code> file.</li>
    </ol>

  <p>Now you're ready to go! You can create any commands you'd like to handle in the <code>discord</code> directory of the project. This is a miniature version of the bots you see on Discord and a great platform to learn.</p>
